# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution. This document covers everything
needed to submit a plugin: structure requirements, category-specific
interface contracts, and how to run the validator before submitting a pull
request.

Read the category README for the category you are contributing to before
starting. The interface contracts differ by category.

- [agent-scripts/README.md](agent-scripts/README.md)
- [manager/README.md](manager/README.md)
- [auth/README.md](auth/README.md)


## Plugin structure

Every plugin lives in its own subfolder under its category:

```
<category>/<plugin-name>/
    README.md
    LICENSE
    sbom.json
    <plugin files>
```

All three metadata files are required for every plugin in every category.
A plugin missing any of them will not pass validation.


## Required metadata files

`README.md`
: Documents the plugin. Required headings differ by category (see below).
  Written in British English. No index of other plugins; each README covers
  only its own plugin.

`LICENSE`
: The licence for this plugin. The licence may differ from other plugins in
  the repository. Document it clearly. MIT is the default if there is no
  reason to use another.

`sbom.json`
: Software Bill of Materials in CycloneDX JSON format. Must be valid JSON
  and must contain `bomFormat`, `specVersion`, and `components` fields.
  List all runtime dependencies, including system packages. For Debian
  packages, use `pkg:deb/debian/<package>` as the `purl`.

Minimal `sbom.json` example:

```json
{
  "bomFormat": "CycloneDX",
  "specVersion": "1.5",
  "version": 1,
  "metadata": {
    "component": {
      "type": "application",
      "name": "my-plugin",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "description": "One-line description"
    }
  },
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "library",
      "name": "bash",
      "version": "5.2",
      "description": "GNU Bourne Again shell",
      "purl": "pkg:deb/debian/bash"
    }
  ]
}
```


## README required headings

Each category has a specific set of required headings. The validator checks
for these exactly. Use ATX-style headers (`## Heading`).

Agent scripts (`agent-scripts/`):

```
## Purpose
## Dependencies
## Installation
## scripts.conf
## Subcommands
## Examples
## Limitations
```

Auth hooks (`auth/`):

```
## Purpose
## Dependencies
## Installation
## Configuration
## Exit codes
## Examples
## Limitations
```

Manager plugins (`manager/`):

```
## Purpose
## Dependencies
## Installation
## Configuration
## Examples
## Limitations
```


## Category interface contracts

### agent-scripts

Scripts receive a JSON context object on stdin. Discard it if not needed:

```bash
exec 0</dev/null
```

Scripts must exit 0 on success and non-zero on failure. stdout and stderr
are both captured and returned to the caller.

Scripts must use the subcommand pattern: the first argument selects the
operation. Calling the script with no arguments must print usage to stderr
and exit non-zero. Calling with an unrecognised subcommand must do the same.

Script names must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`. This is the allowlist name pattern
enforced by the agent.

Test scripts against a real `scripts.conf` entry before submitting. Verify
each subcommand runs correctly and that the no-args path exits non-zero.

Some plugins in this category contain no agent script - only a dispatcher-side
coordinator that orchestrates other agent scripts via the ctrl-exec API. Add
an empty `COORDINATOR_ONLY` file to the plugin directory to indicate this to
the validator:

```bash
touch my-plugin/COORDINATOR_ONLY
```

The validator skips the agent script checks for these plugins. The README must
still document which agent scripts are required as prerequisites.

### auth hooks

Hooks receive full request context as environment variables and as JSON on
stdin. Read `auth/README.md` for the full variable and field reference.

Hooks must handle malformed or empty stdin without crashing - exit 1 (denied)
on any unhandled error. This is a hard requirement: ctrl-exec treats a
crash the same as a denial, but a hook that produces unexpected output or
leaves background processes running creates operational problems.

Exit codes must be exactly 0, 1, 2, or 3. No output on stdout or stderr.

### ctrl-exec-cli

Manager plugins consume the ctrl-exec HTTP API. Do not hardcode hostnames
or script names - use `GET /openapi-live.json` or `GET /discovery` for
runtime enumeration.

Document the async pattern (`POST /run` → `GET /status/{reqid}`) wherever
the plugin submits long-running scripts. Include the recommended polling
interval and timeout strategy.


## Running the validator

Run the validator against your plugin before opening a pull request. The
validator is at `tools/validate-plugin` in the repository root.

```bash
tools/validate-plugin agent-scripts/my-plugin
tools/validate-plugin auth/my-hook
tools/validate-plugin manager/my-manager
```

The validator checks:

- Required files present (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `sbom.json`)
- Required README headings present for the category
- `sbom.json` is valid JSON with required CycloneDX fields
- For agent scripts: script is executable, has a shebang, name matches the
  allowlist pattern, exits non-zero with output when called with no args
- For auth hooks: hook is executable, has a shebang, exits with a valid
  code (0–3) on empty stdin and on a synthetic ping payload

A plugin must produce `VALID` with zero failures before submission. Pull
requests are validated automatically on open and on each subsequent push.

Example of a passing run:

```
Validating plugin: linux-audit (category: agent-scripts)
Path: agent-scripts/linux-audit

[ Required files ]
  PASS  README.md exists
  PASS  LICENSE exists
  PASS  sbom.json exists

[ README sections ]
  PASS  README has '## Purpose'
  ...

Results: 21 passed, 0 failed
VALID
```


## General guidelines

Dependencies
: Prefer Debian trixie system packages. If a dependency is not in the Debian
  trixie package set, document why and what the operator must install manually.
  OpenWRT scripts may depend on OpenWRT-specific tools.

Testing
: Test against the minimum dependency set where practical. Include a worked
  test run in the README Examples section showing real output from a real host.

Privilege
: Document any privilege requirements explicitly. If a script requires root,
  say so. If it can run as a less-privileged user, show the sudoers rule
  needed to enable this.

Idempotency
: Scripts that modify state should be idempotent where possible. Document
  any cases where running the same subcommand twice has different effects.

Atomicity
: Write operations that modify files should use a write-to-temp-then-rename
  pattern to avoid partial writes.

British English
: All written content - README, comments, output strings - uses British
  English spelling throughout.
